    This app utilizes the live data from this <a href="https://corona-api.com/">Corona API</a> and displays them in a convenient and informative way for the user. It makes it easy for its users to stay updated with the latest numbers of the virus in their own country as well as inform them of the conditions of other countries around the world.

## Purpose

I created this project after I noticed that the people in my community had no concept of how bad Covid-19 was around the world. It wasn't nearly as bad here as it was in some other parts of the world. To develop a sense of awareness and caution for such a big-scale event, you need to understand the scale and be aware of the worst-case scenario. So, to educate my community, I decided to build this app. It gives the users all the critical numbers (case numbers, deaths, hospitalization rate, etc.) for countries worldwide simply and interactively.

I distributed this project to many of my friends and classmates, whom I asked to continue sharing with their friends. Several people have admitted to me that they had no idea how bad Covid-19 was outside of British Columbia, and many have gasped upon seeing the statistics. I believe that this project has impacted my community and better prepared them for the spike in the pandemic that was to come.
