# VIRIDI - trash2trees


Viridi (Latin for Fresh/Green) aims to unite isolated action, acting as a larger-scale community for the environmentally-minded, as well as to raise funds for deserving tree-planting organizations. Our inspiration was the social media trends that have been occurring recently on platforms such as Tik Tok, Instagram, and Snapchat. Viridi aims to facilitate marketing strategies within these apps that could be utilized to act upon issues that are trendy at the moment.


##  What It Does

Users can upload before and after pictures of places they’ve cleaned up, with a location and caption tagged. Other users can upvote, comment, etc. This can be converted to social media currency known as seeds.

With the currency earned through posting and receiving upvotes, users can spend the currency within the in-app store to “buy trees”. Money acquired from the platform would go towards donating to tree-planting organizations.
